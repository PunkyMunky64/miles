The class milesString is minorly based on the code for CStr.h and CStr.cpp by Brian Overland in 1996. This code was excerpted from the book "C++ in Plain English [by Brian Overland, 1996]". The rest of the code is written by myself, and although I fully understand the CStr code and made modifications to it, I cannot take full credit for it.
